# PRO-C35-REATE-A-VIRTUAL-PET-APP.
In Class 35 you created a form for players to log in, added input for name and button to Play. You also created playerCount and gameState in the database. You learned to update gameState and player count to database.  In this project you will apply the concepts learned in class and continue to add more elements to the virtual pet app.
